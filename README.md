# DVBT-DVBT2

## DVBT

In This project I present the cpu based DVBT protocol as a transmitter and I am developing GPU based receiver.

In This project, the transmitter is based on a code one of my friends released. You can find it [in his github page](https://github.com/mkh1992/DVBT-Transmitter).

For the transmitter we should implement these processing blocks[^1]:
- [x] PRBS Sequence Generator
- [x] Reed Solomon Encoder
- [x] Data Interleaver
- [x] Convolutional Encoder
- [ ] Data Demultiplexer
